add reranking
change main embedding model
improve chunking strategy
at some point when i am satisfied with the rag pipeline i can start adding tool use with langchain (idk if i can run locally tho

start with add reranking ig
think im done with a baseline reranker

got some more work

wanna implement better chunking strategies
my idea is to do it based on headings within the markdown so that i can differentiate each topic into subtopics so that a whole relevant idea will be represented in each chunk
